            <p> When you hear about this inspiring woman the first thing to mind is her music! Selena Quintanilla was a very successful women not to mention tremendously gorgeous! Her career started just like everyone else's, at rock bottom. She first start recording professionally in 1981. Tejan music was more a male music gender and so people would mistreat her for what she loved doing. Venues around Texas would shut her and out therefor she wasn't able to preform. Selena was so idepentent and didn't give up until she had the ability to do what she desired most. Later when her amazing talent was finally discovered people started going crazy and had loads of affection towards her. Especially After winning the Tejan Music Award her career had blown off. In her time she had won various awards, started her own fashion line boutique, and became one of the the best female artists in Latin music history. Sadly with deep sorrow her friend and former mananger, shot Selena Quintanilla. George W. Bush decalred that Selena's birthday as Selena Day in Texas. That's how big and important of a role model, she meant to people. To this day the Queen lives on in our hearts and through her music. Selena may not be here but she lives on forever.
